# Machine_Learning_Covid
In this repositroy I have uploaded codes for Corona virus data analysis using machine learning models.
We have used here Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVM regression and Tree Regression Model.
## Notebooks:
1. data_extract.ipynb: To extract COVID data from ChemBl website.
2. Cov_data_analyse.ipynb: To analyse COVID data, do preprocessing and finally apply
Machine Learning Algorithms to do different kinds of fittings to data. I have used Linear
Regression, Polynomial Regression, Tree Regression, and Support Vector Regression
to fit COVID data and shown the performance of Algorithms using r2_score.
## Data:
1. bioactivity_data.csv: It contains raw data that we obtained after executing
"data_extract.ipynb" file.
